## About
The Restuction app was developed to try and create a database where professionals from the construction industry can either advertise or find items 
(materials or objects), that are still very usable but are going to be destroyed or removed form a building due to refurbishment or demolition. This effort 
is to try and combat the 40% that the construction industry claims of the worlds total carbon production every year. <br>
<br>
A lot of this carbon produced is from materials and objects that are being produced for new buildings even though there are perfectly got alternatives available. 
anot only does the production of these items produce carbon but the packaging and shipping can often produce even more carbon than the product itself. If Restruction
can help just one item from unnecessarily being destroyed, it is a victory!

### Design

- #### Colour Scheme
    - The Universal colour for recycling is green. It has always been recognised as that so naturally, I felt Restruction should have green as the main colour. 
    I also wanted it to be light and welcoming to give a positive vibe and emotion as the aim and ethos of Restruction is that of positivity and optimism.
    - The main colour is De York (essentially a Light Green). The Secondary colour is white. The 2 remaining colours in the pallet below are the alternating 
    background colours for the items dropdowns and are Aqua Spring and Alice Blue. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="./static/images/readme/restruction_colours.png" height="150px"/>

- #### Typography
    - The Font used throughout the entire website is Raleway. It is a very clean font which I wanted as in general, I want the website to be clean to give the 
    feeling that it and the items posted on it are prestine. 
    <br>
    <img src="./static/images/readme/restruction_font1.png" height="50px"/><img src="./static/images/readme/restruction_font2.png" height="50px"/>

- #### Imagery
    - For the Restruction logo, I have used the Universal Recycling Symbol that was originaly designed by a college student back in 1970. As is described in its name, 
    it is universal and one of the most recognizable icons in the world. I used Font Awesome (fa-recycle) and Raleway font saying "Restruction" to create the logo. 
    It is very simple and clean and because it does not feature an image, it is always brilliant quality no matter what screen resolution. <br>
